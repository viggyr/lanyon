Intersection of Arts and Artificial Intelligence excites me. Right from my childhood, I have been taking part in various cultural art forms originating from my hometown, such as Yakshagana, Bharatnatyam, carnatic music, drama, and few more. Quite recently I was fortunate to discover my passion in fictional writing. Having done my major in computer science from RV College of Engineering and spending the next two years working for a boston-based young AI and Cloud startup - [Soroco](https://soroco.com/), I keenly look forward to apply my knowledge and expertise to cultural arts and literature. All my upcoming works would be directed towards this goal.
