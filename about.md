title: Intersection of Arts and Artificial Intelligence excites me. Right from my childhood, I have been taking part in various cultural art forms originating from my hometown, such as Yakshagana, Bharatnatyam, carnatic music, drama, and few more. Quite recently I also discovered my passion in fictional writing. Having done my major in computer science, I keenly look forward to apply it to cultural arts and literature. All my upcoming works would be directed towards this goal.
